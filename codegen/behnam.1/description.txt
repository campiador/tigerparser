PROJECT 5: Code Generator by Behnam

(a) help:
	Matt Ahrens with functional programming
        Karl Cronburg with 6 arguments and then rest of list
	Jared Chandler: talked about binops.

(b) interesting details:
	I learned how to use "case" which helped me a lot with binop implementation.

	The hardest part was passing arguments to functions in registerfile and on stack based on the number of the arguments.

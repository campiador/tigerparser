(a) help:
	Prof. Guyer with CALL return and recursion
	Moses Huang with symgen
	Matt Ahrens with foldr and recursion for IF
	Jared Chandler with comparisons
	Jeanne-Marrie Musca with map function
	Diogenes Nunez with understanding functional programming and SML

(b) interesting details:
	The foldr function was not included in the documents suggested in 181 home page. I found it very useful for this assignment, when iterating lists.
	Also implementing the IF function was the hardest challenge. I sepnt the whole Thanksgiving weekend, plus the next Monday on it. So rewarding.
